    <hl3>Storage Options:</hl3>
    <p>
      PNG FS provides many ways to store your files to Flickr. Each encoding method has its own advantages and disadvantages
    <ul>
      <li><em> Storage mode </em> does not try to make your data look good, it simply stores as much data as possible in each image. This is the best choice for users interested in using all of the space provided by Flickr. This is also the fastest way to convert your data to an image.</li>
      
      <li><em>Stealth mode</em> trys to make your image look as similar to the image you provide as possible. This mode does not allow you to store as much non-image data as the other modes, and may take a long time to convert your data to an image. However, it can be very useful if you wish to preserve the appearence of pictures on your Flickr account.</li> 

      <li><em>Balance mode</em> trys to balance the appearence of your images with maximum storage. You may see strange color distortions and scattered alpha values. This is the most efficient way to store data after Storage mode</li>

      <li><em>Preservation mode</em> is the only mode which allows you to recover the base image without losing any data. While your images will look a little strange on Flickr, you will still be able to download the original image, remove the alpha values and have the same picture you started with.</li>
